            <summary><strong>CSS: History & Basic Rules</strong></summary>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 to separate content (HTML) from presentation (design). The first official version, CSS1, was released in 1996, followed by CSS2 with layout features like positioning, and later CSS3, which introduced a modular system for faster and independent updates.</p>

            <p>CSS works by applying rules that define how HTML elements should be styled. Each rule has a <strong>selector</strong> (which targets elements) and a <strong>declaration block</strong> (which contains property-value pairs like <code>color: red;</code>). The "cascade" in CSS means that when multiple rules apply, the most specific or latest one usually takes effect.</p>

            <p>Modern CSS includes powerful tools like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>CSS Variables</strong> – Reusable custom values for consistent theming.</li>
              <li><strong>Flexbox & Grid</strong> – Layout systems for building responsive designs.</li>
              <li><strong>Aspect-Ratio</strong> – Keeps elements proportional across devices.</li>
              <li><strong>Media Queries</strong> – Enables mobile-first and responsive styling.</li>
              <li><strong>New Color Functions</strong> – Like <code>color-mix()</code> and <code>color-contrast()</code>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> Write clean, modular CSS with low specificity, avoid overly complex selectors, and use logical structure to make styles easier to maintain and scale.</p>

            <summary><strong>JavaScript: History & Key Milestones</strong></summary>
            <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape. Originally named Mocha, then LiveScript, it was finally renamed JavaScript to align with the popularity of Java at the time. It was developed in just 10 days to bring interactive behavior to websites.</p>

            <p>In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for standardization, leading to the first ECMAScript specification (ES1) in 1997. Over time, ECMAScript evolved: ES3 (1999) introduced features like regular expressions and exception handling, while ES5 (2009) added strict mode and JSON support.</p>

            <p>The release of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) marked a major update, adding features like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Let & Const</strong> – Improved variable scoping and declarations.</li>
              <li><strong>Arrow Functions</strong> – Shorter function syntax with lexical <code>this</code>.</li>
              <li><strong>Promises</strong> – A cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations.</li>
              <li><strong>Classes & Modules</strong> – Support for object-oriented and modular code.</li>
              <li><strong>Template Literals</strong> – Enhanced string formatting with embedded expressions.</li>
            

            <p>In 2009, the introduction of Node.js allowed JavaScript to run on the server, turning it into a full-stack language. Today, JavaScript powers both client- and server-side applications, supported by frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.</p>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>JavaScript: Pre vs Post Incrementation</strong></summary>
            <p>In JavaScript, the <code>++</code> operator increases a number by 1. Its position changes how it behaves:</p>

            <p><strong>🔁 Pre-increment (<code>++x</code>)</strong>: Increments the value first, then returns it.</p>
            <pre><code>let x = 5;
let y = ++x; // x = 6, y = 6</code></pre>

            <p><strong>🔁 Post-increment (<code>x++</code>)</strong>: Returns the current value, then increments.</p>
            <pre><code>let x = 5;
let y = x++; // x = 6, y = 5</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Use Case Tip:</strong> Use <code>++x</code> when you need the updated value immediately. Use <code>x++</code> when the current value is needed before incrementing.</p>
          </details>
          <!-- Detail: Latest HTML Version -->
<details>
  <summary><strong>The Latest Version of HTML</strong></summary>
  <p>The latest version of HTML is <strong>HTML5</strong>, which is now the global standard for creating and structuring web pages. HTML5 introduces powerful new semantic elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, which make web content more meaningful and accessible to both users and search engines.</p>
  
  <p>It provides native support for multimedia through the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. HTML5 also includes APIs for advanced web features, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Canvas API</strong> – Draw and animate 2D graphics directly in the browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Storage (localStorage/sessionStorage)</strong> – Store data on the client side for faster performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Geolocation API</strong> – Access a user's location with permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop API</strong> – Simplify interactive interfaces without external libraries.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>HTML5 also improves accessibility with ARIA roles and better support for screen readers, and it is fully responsive, making it ideal for mobile and desktop devices. It continues to evolve with incremental updates that enhance performance, security, and integration with modern CSS and JavaScript technologies.</p>

<!-- Detail: Non-Latin Words in URLs -->
<details>
  <summary><strong>Non-Latin Words in URLs</strong></summary>
  <p>Modern web standards allow <strong>non-Latin characters in URLs</strong> using <strong>Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</strong>. This enables web addresses to include characters from scripts such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Hindi, and more, making URLs more readable and culturally relevant for global users.</p>
  
  <p>Browsers convert these characters into a standardized ASCII-compatible format called <strong>Punycode</strong>. For example, the Cyrillic domain <code>пример.рф</code> becomes <code>xn--e1afmkfd.xn--p1ai</code> internally. This ensures that all domain names remain compatible with the Domain Name System (DNS).</p>
  
  <p>Using IRIs improves user experience and search engine indexing for multilingual websites. However, developers should ensure proper encoding in HTML and server configurations to avoid broken links or security issues. Tools like <code>encodeURI()</code> in JavaScript or server-side URL encoding functions can help manage this automatically.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always test your internationalized URLs in multiple browsers and devices to ensure proper display and functionality.</p>

                <h2>Early Development</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The web started as a research initiative by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 to create a global information system. In 1990, he developed the first web browser, <strong>WorldWideWeb</strong> (later renamed <em>Nexus</em>), which allowed users to navigate and access server-stored information more easily than with command-line tools [1]. This browser supported basic text formatting and hyperlinks, laying the foundation of the modern web.</p>

            <p>This invention marked the beginning of browsers as essential applications for fetching data from servers and rendering it for human use. Without such a tool, the internet would have remained a purely technical system accessible only to specialists.</p>

                <h2>Rise of Graphical Browsers</h2>
            </header>
            <p>By 1993, graphical browsers like <strong>Mosaic</strong> revolutionized the browsing experience by integrating images with text, a huge leap beyond text-only interfaces [2]. According to GeeksforGeeks, Mosaic’s ability to display inline images attracted mainstream users and made the web more appealing as a communication tool.</p>

            <p>Netscape Navigator (1994) quickly followed, becoming the first widely adopted commercial browser. Netscape introduced innovations such as cookies, JavaScript, and a more intuitive interface. However, Microsoft’s launch of Internet Explorer in 1995 triggered the famous “browser wars.” Bundling Internet Explorer with Windows gave Microsoft a competitive advantage, forcing Netscape to lose market share dramatically. Meanwhile, Opera (1996) entered the scene, designed to be lightweight and faster than its rivals.</p>

                <h2>Modern Browsers and Trends</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In 1998, Netscape released its source code, creating the Mozilla project, which eventually produced <strong>Firefox</strong>. Apple entered the market in 2003 with <strong>Safari</strong>, tailored for Mac OS. In 2008, Google launched <strong>Chrome</strong>, emphasizing speed, simplicity, and security [3]. Chrome quickly overtook rivals and today remains the most widely used browser globally. Microsoft retired Internet Explorer in 2015, introducing <strong>Edge</strong> built on modern web standards.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen the rise of alternative browsers such as <strong>Brave</strong> and <strong>Vivaldi</strong>, which emphasize privacy, customization, and ad-blocking. GeeksforGeeks notes that browsers have evolved into full-fledged platforms offering features like tabbed browsing, bookmarks, extensions, synchronization across devices, phishing protection, and sandboxed security.</p>

            <p>According to Telefónica (2024), Chrome dominates with around <em>64.7 %</em> of global usage. Safari ranks second (~18.6 %), followed by Edge, Firefox, and Opera. These statistics underline how browser competition has consolidated into a few major players, even as niche browsers innovate on privacy and user experience.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The evolution of browsers mirrors the history of the web itself: from basic tools for scientists to powerful, user-friendly platforms used daily by billions. Each generation of browsers has added improvements in speed, design, security, and compatibility. Looking forward, priorities such as privacy protection, AI-powered assistance, and seamless cross-device experiences will likely define the next era of web browsing.</p>
