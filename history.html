                <h2>Early Development</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The web started as a research initiative by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 to create a global information system. In 1990, he developed the first web browser, <strong>WorldWideWeb</strong> (later renamed <em>Nexus</em>), which allowed users to navigate and access server-stored information more easily than with command-line tools [1]. This browser supported basic text formatting and hyperlinks, laying the foundation of the modern web.</p>

            <p>This invention marked the beginning of browsers as essential applications for fetching data from servers and rendering it for human use. Without such a tool, the internet would have remained a purely technical system accessible only to specialists.</p>

                <h2>Rise of Graphical Browsers</h2>
            </header>
            <p>By 1993, graphical browsers like <strong>Mosaic</strong> revolutionized the browsing experience by integrating images with text, a huge leap beyond text-only interfaces [2]. According to GeeksforGeeks, Mosaic’s ability to display inline images attracted mainstream users and made the web more appealing as a communication tool.</p>

            <p>Netscape Navigator (1994) quickly followed, becoming the first widely adopted commercial browser. Netscape introduced innovations such as cookies, JavaScript, and a more intuitive interface. However, Microsoft’s launch of Internet Explorer in 1995 triggered the famous “browser wars.” Bundling Internet Explorer with Windows gave Microsoft a competitive advantage, forcing Netscape to lose market share dramatically. Meanwhile, Opera (1996) entered the scene, designed to be lightweight and faster than its rivals.</p>

                <h2>Modern Browsers and Trends</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In 1998, Netscape released its source code, creating the Mozilla project, which eventually produced <strong>Firefox</strong>. Apple entered the market in 2003 with <strong>Safari</strong>, tailored for Mac OS. In 2008, Google launched <strong>Chrome</strong>, emphasizing speed, simplicity, and security [3]. Chrome quickly overtook rivals and today remains the most widely used browser globally. Microsoft retired Internet Explorer in 2015, introducing <strong>Edge</strong> built on modern web standards.</p>

            <p>Recent years have seen the rise of alternative browsers such as <strong>Brave</strong> and <strong>Vivaldi</strong>, which emphasize privacy, customization, and ad-blocking. GeeksforGeeks notes that browsers have evolved into full-fledged platforms offering features like tabbed browsing, bookmarks, extensions, synchronization across devices, phishing protection, and sandboxed security.</p>

            <p>According to Telefónica (2024), Chrome dominates with around <em>64.7 %</em> of global usage. Safari ranks second (~18.6 %), followed by Edge, Firefox, and Opera. These statistics underline how browser competition has consolidated into a few major players, even as niche browsers innovate on privacy and user experience.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The evolution of browsers mirrors the history of the web itself: from basic tools for scientists to powerful, user-friendly platforms used daily by billions. Each generation of browsers has added improvements in speed, design, security, and compatibility. Looking forward, priorities such as privacy protection, AI-powered assistance, and seamless cross-device experiences will likely define the next era of web browsing.</p>
